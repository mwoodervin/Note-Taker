  ## DESCRIPTION
  This application allows busy individuals manage identified tasks.

  When launched, the application takes the user to a landing page where a "note" page can be accessed. On this page, the user is able to create, save, and delete notes to identify and manage tasks throughout the day.

  When the user leaves the site, saved notes are stored and avaiable when the application is relaunched.
